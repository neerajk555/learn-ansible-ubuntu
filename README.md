## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Ubuntu 20.04+ with internet access
2. **Start here**: [Lesson 1: Introduction to Ansible](lessons/lesson-01-introduction.md)
3. **Follow sequentially**: Each lesson builds on previous concepts
4. **Practice**: Complete all hands-on exercises for best results

## üß≠ Why localhost? Local vs web server

We start on localhost (your own Ubuntu machine/VM) because it‚Äôs fast, safe, and requires no SSH setup. Ansible can run tasks directly on the control node when you set `ansible_connection=local`, so there‚Äôs no network dependency. The same playbooks later work on real servers‚Äîjust switch your inventory to remote hosts and use SSH.

- Localhost: runs tasks locally with `ansible_connection=local` (no SSH)
- Remote web server: runs tasks over SSH to another machine
- Privileges: `become: yes` still uses sudo locally or remotely
- Inventory: `localhost` entry vs. IP/hostnames for real servers

Read the detailed guide with examples and pitfalls: [docs/localhost-vs-webserver.md](docs/localhost-vs-webserver.md)

## üíª What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have:

- ‚úÖ **Automated server setup** - Install packages, configure services, manage users
- ‚úÖ **Multi-node infrastructure** - Control multiple VMs with a single command  
- ‚úÖ **Web application deployment** - Deploy static sites with dynamic templates
- ‚úÖ **Complete LAMP stack** - Automated Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP deployment
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready practices** - Version control, error handling, debugging
- ‚úÖ **Reusable automation** - Organized roles and playbooks for future projects

### Final Project Preview
Your capstone project automatically provisions:
```bash
# Single command deploys everything:
ansible-playbook playbooks/lamp.yml
```
- üåê Apache web servers with PHP
- üóÑÔ∏è MariaDB database with sample data  
- üîó PHP application connecting to database
